As its purpose was to send free books for 'winners' among his blog readers, the game itself was not hard. Based on Hao's description, it needs at least 2-3 hr to finish. 

# Why this repo

2014 was my gap year. I was hesitating between standing still and firm at molecular biology and taking the challenges to move to bioinformatics and furthermore computer science. I managed to reach **thy* final round of this puzzle game, and most important, all by myself. It greatly cheered me up because I was almost newbie to CS as a student majoring in biology. 

Actually for short, I am cleaning up my laptop storage as it needs more space to be udgraded to El Captain, oh no, Capitan.
